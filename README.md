**Requirements:**  

Texpert was initially designed for linux but can be made to work on other operating systems.  
Note: Program will render differently on other OS's, and may lose some functionality.

**Macs:**   
Mac users should have no problem as long as OS X is installed (since OS X is Unix based).

**Windows:**   
Windows users will need to make program executable using PyInstaller or similiar program.  
```pip install pyinstaller```

Program uses systems default color scheme, so will look different on each OS.  
If problems occur, or a black hole forms, please let me know.
